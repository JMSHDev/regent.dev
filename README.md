# UBA
Universal Business Adapter

A program/service that accepts or makes a variety of connections, listens and sends data on to other connections.
For example, UDP to HTTP, or MQTT to HTTP, or TCP to Database!

Must be abe to be configured by the user to operate on desired protocols, ports etc.
Must be easily configured to filter when/what to send on, and where to.
Must be reliable and low-footprint.

## Use case
As a developer, 
I want to have a quick drop-in solution 
that I can use to connect a product that communicates using protocol X 
to a service that communicates using protocol Y, 
so that I don't have to worry about relying low-level protocol code.

Should be open-source (GPL 3?) with commercial license option(s), to allow try-before-you-buy

## How to commercialise?
* paid commercial OEM license for on-device
* paid commercial license for website
* paid hosted option?
* paid more advanced configuration/extensibility/logging?
